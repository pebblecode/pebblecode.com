    %h2.size2 What's new?
    %p At the end of last year we gave away 2 months of development to <a href="http://www.access2insulin.org/">The International Insulin Foundation</a> in an effort to help them raise awareness of the global diabetes crisis. The campaign is called the <a href="http://100campaign.org/">100 Campaign</a> and the redesign is all set for launch in early May 2013 - we will update once the site is live.
